 # Next Steps and Improvements for Productionizing the Garbage Classification Model

 This document outlines recommended next steps, improvements, and missing components to bring the current garbage classification PoC into a robust, maintainable production system.

 ## 1. Modularize and Parameterize the Training Pipeline
 - **Description**: Decouple hard-coded values and scripts by introducing a configuration-driven pipeline (e.g., using YAML/JSON configurations or a library like Hydra). Provide a single entrypoint script to orchestrate data loading, model building, training, evaluation, and artifact management.
 - **Benefit**: Improves reproducibility, makes experiments traceable, and simplifies hyperparameter tuning and automation.

 ## 2. Implement Automated Unit and Integration Testing
 - **Description**: Add pytest-based tests for data preprocessing functions, model architecture integrity, and end-to-end training loops (mocked). Validate expected outputs, shapes, and failure modes.
 - **Benefit**: Guarantees code reliability, prevents regressions, and enables safe refactoring.

 ## 3. Integrate Experiment Tracking and Visualization
 - **Description**: Standardize on MLflow or a similar system for logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts. Ensure versioning of code, data, and models.
 - **Benefit**: Enhances transparency, collaboration, and model auditing capabilities.

 ## 4. Build CI/CD Pipeline
 - **Description**: Create GitHub Actions or another CI/CD pipeline to automate linting, testing, Docker builds, and deployment (to staging or model registry).
 - **Benefit**: Accelerates delivery, enforces quality gates, and maintains consistency across environments.

 ## 5. Containerization and Deployment Strategy
 - **Description**: Refine the Dockerfile to include both training and serving images. Provide Helm/Kubernetes manifests or Docker Compose for scalable deployment.
 - **Benefit**: Simplifies environment management and ensures parity between development and production.

 ## 6. Data Validation and Monitoring
 - **Description**: Add checks for data schema, missing values, and data drift (e.g., using Great Expectations). Incorporate runtime monitoring of inputs and predictions.
 - **Benefit**: Improves data quality, early detection of anomalies, and model reliability.

 ## 7. Model Performance Monitoring and Alerting
 - **Description**: Implement a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) to track inference latency, error rates, and accuracy on new data.
 - **Benefit**: Ensures SLA compliance and timely detection of model degradation.

 ## 8. Documentation and Onboarding
 - **Description**: Enhance README, inline docstrings, and generate API/reference documentation (e.g., with Sphinx). Provide a quickstart guide for developers and stakeholders.
 - **Benefit**: Reduces onboarding time and improves maintainability.
